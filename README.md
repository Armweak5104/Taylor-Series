# Taylor-Series
Visualization of different terms of the Taylor Series of sinx
The ouput produces 4 seemingly unrelated
However each graph is the representation of what happens when the number of terms in the taylor series of sin x changes. 
When using it you may want to ensure the scale of each graph is the same by zooming in to -1 to 1 on the x and y axis
